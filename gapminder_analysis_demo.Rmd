```{r, echo=F}
#install.packages("dplyr")

library(dplyr)
```

```{r read-in-data}
gap.in <- read.table("output//combined_gapMinder.tsv", sep="\t", header=T)

gap.in %>%
  select(pop, country, continent) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarise(avg=mean(pop))
```
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
